This was a project that I did while working at Xero. 

It is a cache for AWS that allows you to pull in data from the AWS API and then dump it into a Redis keystore. 

This version works, you will just have to setup a docker container and download the repo, make sure that you set your AWS credentials using the aws configure command locally 

then run: 
go run
